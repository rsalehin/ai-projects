The `mask.py` script is a Python program that uses a pre-trained BERT model for masked language modeling. 

The script takes a text input from the user, tokenizes it, and checks for the presence of a mask token. 
If the mask token is not present, the program exits with an error message. 
The script is set up to generate a certain number of predictions (defined by `K`) and includes constants for generating attention diagrams. The attention diagrams are created using the PIL library for image manipulation. The script is designed to be run as a standalone program with its main execution starting from the `main()` function.
