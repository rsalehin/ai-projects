shopping.py is a Python script that uses machine learning to predict shopping behavior. It uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm from the sklearn library to train a model based on a given dataset.

The script accepts a CSV file as a command-line argument, which is expected to contain the shopping data. This data is loaded and split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from sklearn.model_selection.

The model is then trained using the training data and used to make predictions on the test data. The script evaluates the performance of the model by calculating the sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) based on the predictions and actual labels from the test set.

The results, including the number of correct and incorrect predictions and the true positive and negative rates, are printed to the console.

The load_data function is responsible for loading the shopping data from the CSV file and converting it into a list of evidence lists and a list of labels.
