The `heredity.py` script is a Python program that simulates the genetic traits inheritance based on the principles of Mendelian genetics. The script uses predefined probabilities for the presence of a specific gene and the manifestation of a trait given the gene's presence. The probabilities are stored in the `PROBS` dictionary, which includes unconditional probabilities for having 0, 1, or 2 copies of a gene, and conditional probabilities for exhibiting a trait given the number of gene copies. The script likely uses these probabilities to perform simulations or predictions about the inheritance of traits. The specific functionality of the script can be better understood by examining the rest of the code.
